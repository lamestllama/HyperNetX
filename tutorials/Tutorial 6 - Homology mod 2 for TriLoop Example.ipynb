Because we are only interested in the presence of data in these cells, we use $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients so that the elements of $C_i$ may be thought of as sets of $i$-cells in the ASC.\n",

The failure of the chain complex to be exact is measured by the dimension of its associated homology groups. \n",

Do the same for $k+1$.** This representation is the Smith Normal Form of the matrix. Once it is computed, the homology groups can be generated by reading off information from the invertible matrices $P_i,Q_i$.\n",
    "4. **Compute the kernel of $\\partial_k$, $Z_k$.** This is the subgroup of $C_k$ generated by its cycles. It is found by taking the last $n$ columns of $Q_k$ where $n$ is the number of zero columns in $S_k$.\n",
    "5. **Compute the image and cokernel of $\\partial_{k+1}$, $B_k$.** The image is the subgroup of $Z_k$ generated by boundaries. It is found by taking the first $r$ columns of $P_{k+1}^{-1}$ where $r$ equals the number of nonzero rows in $S_{k+1}$. The cokernel is generated by the remaining columns of $P_{k+1}^{-1}$. The $k$-homology group is:\n",

    "Consider the product: $\\partial_{k+1} Q_{k+1} = P_{k+1}^{-1}S_{k+1}$, gotten by rewriting the Smith Normal Form for $\\partial_{k+1}$. Since $Q_{k+1}$ is an isomorphism, the image of $Q_{k+1}$ is just $C_{k+1}$. Hence the image of $\\partial_{k+1}$ is the same as the image of $P_{k+1}^{-1}S_{k+1}$. By examining this product we see the image of $P_{k+1}^{-1}S_{k+1}$ has a basis given by the columns in $P_{k+1}^{-1}$ corresponding to the nonzero rows in $S_{k+1}$. Moreover the cokernel of $\\partial_{k+1}$ has a basis given by the columns in $P_{k+1}^{-1}$ corresponding to the zero rows in $S_{k+1}$. The image and cokernel decompose C[k] into disjoint subgroups. \n",

This means that $k$-cycles in $Z_k$ are the same in $H_k(ASC)$ if they differ by an element of $B_k$. If we think of this in terms of the decomposition above, we are only interested in the part of the kernel of $\\partial_k$ that dwells in the cokernel of $\\partial_{k+1}$.\n",

    "Similarly, if we restrict $P_{k+1}^{-1}$ to its columns corresponding to the $0$-rows of $S_{k+1}$ we obtain a projection map $\\pi_2:Cok(\\partial_{k+1}) \\rightarrow C_k$ which returns an element in the cokernel in terms of the $k$-cell basis for $C_k$. \n",

    "We apply $\\pi_1$ to each element of the the kernel basis of $(\\partial_k)$. The resulting vectors will be the coordinates of these vectors in a basis of the cokernel given by columns of $P_{k+1}^{-1}$. Working backwards we apply $\\pi_2$ to the image of the kernel basis to recover the projection of the kernel basis onto the cokernel in terms of the original basis (the $k$-cells for $C_k$). \n",
